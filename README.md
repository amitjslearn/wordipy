# words
work in progress

wordipy is dummy library which can be used ... 

Usage
from wordipy import abbreviationize
abbreviationize(Triple BAM)
abbr= abbreviationize("Triple BAM", sep=",")
all is well
Limitations:
1) input to abbreviationize should be a capital like "C M" to get the output as CM


further/improvement proposal
1) amountize: the amount which is already a number can be retained as it is
2) Stop words can be removed if needed

         
'''only most commonly used tuples (like single, double, triple ,quadruple) are used,
        other tuples can be added [here] as per the needs'''
''' some of the currencies are added (like dollar, rupees, yen) other currencies can be added if required [here].
'''
