### Further improvements/additional features:
1) abbreviationize: input to abbreviationize should be a capital like "C M" to get the output as CM 
for ex c m will not give CM

2) amountize: the amount which is already a number can be retained as it is
3) Stop words can be removed if needed
4) **Lemmatization** and **stemming** can be done properly wherever required

>**Note**    
>1) Only most commonly used tuples (like single, double, triple, quadruple) are used, other tuples can be added as per the needs.
>2) Only some of the currencies are added (like dollar, yen) other currencies can be added if required.
