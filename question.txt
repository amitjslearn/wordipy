Programming Exercise
In this section, we have two parts. For the first part, you need to submit link to a github/gitlab/bitbucket repo with code for the given scenario. Repo must contain a README.md which details the features you have implemented, features you can think of but are yet to be implement and instructions for using your code as a library. Extra credits if you package using setup.py. You are free to use any programming language and all open source libraries. For the second part, you need to submit just a design document.

Part I
Create a reusable library that can convert a paragraph of spoken english to written english. For example, 
1) "two dollars" should be converted to $2. 
2) Abbreviations spoken as "C M" or "Triple A" should be written as "CM" and "AAA" respectively.
 Push your code to a public github/gitlab/bitbucket repo and submit the link here.

Part II
Design a spoken english to written english conversion system that can be continuously matured as you discover more and more conversion rules. For example, you may not have taken care of punctuation rules in the previous part of the exercise. Can you design in a way that such rules can be easily added without having to re-test all the previous rule implementations? Submit link to a google doc or a markdown document in your code repo.
